** Hawaii
   
# Hawaii
lonA=-165
lonB=-145
latA=10
latB=30

- Beta0=30 seems okay, but still diverges at some points
- Beta0=10 seems to work pretty well. Fairly stable.
- Beta0=8  caught 2 of the three

** run-vnp02.sh -153 10 -151 12 0.05

- Unstable square...

rm noggin_krige_-153_0010_-151_0012.h5
./run-vnp02.sh -153 10 -151 12 0.05

Converged with a beta of 30?
